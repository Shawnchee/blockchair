## üìò Project Description

BlockChair is an innovative, blockchain-driven web platform that redefines trust, transparency, and engagement in the world of digital charity. Harnessing the power of Ethereum (ETH) and MetaMask integration, BlockChair enables secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof donations directly to charitable causes. Our mission is to create a transparent ecosystem where donors can witness the real-world impact of their contributions, while empowering charities to operate with increased credibility and efficiency.

At the heart of BlockChair is a smart contract-based milestone release system, which ensures that funds are only disbursed when predefined project goals are met. This eliminates misuse and enhances donor confidence.

With an emphasis on AI-driven safety, analytics, and personalization, BlockChair offers a suite of intelligent tools that improve user experience, vet charitable organizations, and optimize fundraising efforts.
